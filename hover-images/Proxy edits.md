<p style="text-align: justify;">SCOUT has an internal controller that runs on a CAN-based communication protocol. Users can communicate with the controller over CAN through AgileX’s open CAN bus protocol. Open-source software and ROS packages are provided for further communication and control expansion, along with access to the CAN bus and serial ports.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ROS -</b>Robot Operating System (ROS or ros) is an open-source robotics middleware suite. Although ROS is not an operating system but a collection of software frameworks for robot software development, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.</p>

<p>Drivers provided to communicate with the platform’s CAN bus via ROS/Python/C++</p>
<p>Mesh and description files available to visualize and simulate SCOUT 2.0</p>
<p>Gazebo simulation packages provided</p>
